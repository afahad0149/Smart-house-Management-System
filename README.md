# Smart House Management System

### Description
Design and Simulation of a simple smart house system consisting of two features: a) intruder detection, b) temperature monitoring.

The smart house management system is designed to monitor current temperature and humidity. Additionally, it can also monitor intruders coming near to the house. The aim is to monitor the information both from inside and outside the house. Data is transferred between various nodes (Arduino Uno) using RF modules (wireless) and I2C protocol (wired).

The simulation is done in Proteus version 8.6
